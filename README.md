# Warsztaty_2_Warsztat

The aim of this project is to integrate database with OOP. 

Each class implements Active Records design. I have also used Blowfish algorithm JBCrypt to hash the passwords. 
The aim of this program was to create application for the programing school with admin and user panel. Admin panel allows to add/update/delete users/groups/exercises/solutions.

User panel allows to add solution to the exercise and view solutions that have been already submitted.
